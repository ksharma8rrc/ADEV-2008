# ADEV-2008 HOW TO USE THESE CODES?

Welcome ADEV-2008. Please use this git lib to get started with coding. 

There are a few things you must do to make good use of these codes:

### 1. Read the Comments.
### 2. You can always comment in or out a piece of code to check what it does. 
### 3. Make sure to use these codes as a guide. You can copy the data part - enums, lists, arrays, dict, etc. but you must code yourself in a new project.


# Happy Coding !!
